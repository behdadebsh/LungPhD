Lung & MPA Segmentation's documentation!
=============================================

Welcome to lung and vessel segmentation documentation. These scripts are aiming to create an open source work flow for lung segmentation and vessel segmentation using Python 2.7. The scripts are used
This documentation is used for 3D and 1D model acquiring of the vasculature. Requirements for each section of this package is presented below.

Requirements:

i) Lung segmentation:
	- numpy
	- Pydicom
	- scipy
	- scikit image (skimage)
	- mayavi (optional for visualisation purposes in python)
ii) MPA segmentation:
	- numpy
	- Pydicom
	- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
	- Tkinter
	- scipy
	- matplotlib
